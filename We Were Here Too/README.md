# We Were Here Too - Autosplitter

### **[LiveSplit](https://github.com/LiveSplit) autosplitter you can use for a run submission on [Speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/we_were_here_too).**

### Supports:
- Both lord and peasant POV.
- Playing from start or any another level (settings in autosplitter options, see Limitations).
- Auto starting as player appears after opening video (skippable).
- Auto resetting when returning to menu with a running timer.
- Auto splitting on puzzle solving and upon game completion (See Limitations).

### Limitations:
- The auto start will be early when not starting from the game beginning.
- With default method the end split will be triggered if someone dies during the last puzzle. (So your timer will stop before the actual end.)
  - However, it will continue as if it was never stopped when you restart from the game over screen. (This may invalidate your submission.)
  - Another death-proof method is available in autosplitter options "Safe mode", though it will stop later. (It waits for the ending video.)

### Compatibiliy:
- The autosplitter is intended for "Any% Glitchless - Current Version".
  - It might also work for other categories, but it hasn't been tested.
- Works with these [splits files](https://github.com/Zeuba-Speedruns/Splits/tree/main/We%20Were%20Here%20Too).
- Works with these [layouts](https://github.com/Zeuba-Speedruns/Layouts/tree/main/We%20Were%20Here%20Too).
